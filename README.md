# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Project Overview
In this project, I tackled the challenge of predicting customer churn for a Kaggle competition. The objective was to build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service, thereby allowing businesses to implement retention strategies. This project demonstrated my abilities in data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and competition performance.

Tasks Completed
Data Acquisition and Preparation

Obtained the customer churn dataset provided by Kaggle.
Cleaned the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure accurate model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted exploratory data analysis to explore patterns and relationships within the data.
Generated visualizations to understand the distribution of features and identify potential predictors of churn.
Feature Engineering

Engineered features to enhance the predictive capability of the model.
Applied techniques such as encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and creating new features from existing data.
Model Building

Developed and tested various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Optimized hyperparameters to improve model performance.
Model Evaluation

Assessed the performance of the models using cross-validation and performance metrics.
Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation results and competition leaderboard standings.
Submission and Results

Submitted the final model predictions to Kaggle.
Achieved a high accuracy of 99% and a public score of 85, showcasing effective model performance.
Documentation and Reporting

Documented the entire workflow, including data preparation, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
Prepared a report detailing the methodology, results, and insights derived from the project.
